<h1>Top Movies According to Alyanna</h1>
<h2>My Best 3 Movies</h2>
<hr>

<h3>Sonic the Hedgehog 2</h3>
<p>I have been a Sonic fan ever since I was a little kid. I specifically chose the second movie because more of the original characters appeared and Sonic was able to use his Super form. Love it even though it may not the best movie in terms of production, cgi, etc, I still found it enjoyable especially my inner child. The post credits also introduced something that would get even more excited for the third movie. </p>

<h3>Super Mario Bros Movie</h3>
<p>The Super Mario Bros movie is a new movie starring Chris Pratt and it was actually better than I expected. I actually enjoyed this movie a lot. </p>

<h3>Your Name</h3>
<p>This is one of the most iconic anime films everyone should watch because of the plot and animation. I will never get tired of this film.</p>
